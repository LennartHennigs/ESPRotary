Arduino Library to simplify reading rotary encoder data.


Description
-----------

It allows you to use callback functions to be notified when the rotary encoder position changes.
This will reduce and simplify your source code significantly. Tested with Arduino and ESP8266. 
Some of the code based on the library by PJRC (https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html).

How to Use
----------

These are the constructor and the member functions the library provides:

```
	// If you have an encoder which increments multiple times per click, adjust moves_per_click to a higher number
    ESPRotary(
        int pin1, 
        int pin2, 
        int moves_per_click = 1, 
        int lower_bound = -32768, 
        int upper_bound = 32768
        );

    int getPosition();
    int getMovesPerClick();
    void resetPosition(int p = 0);
    byte getDirection();
    String directionToString(byte direction);
    void setChangedHandler(CallbackFunction f);
    void setRightRotationHandler(CallbackFunction f);
    void setLeftRotationHandler(CallbackFunction f);
	
    void loop();
```

The library provides several callback handlers to be notified when the rotary encoder position changes.

**Note:** For the class to work, you need to call the `loop()` member function in your sketch's `loop()` function. See the example for more details.


Installation
------------
Open the Arduino IDE choose "Sketch > Include Library" and search for "ESP Rotary". 
Or download the ZIP archive (https://github.com/lennarthennigs/ESPRotary/zipball/master), and choose "Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library..." and select the downloaded file.
